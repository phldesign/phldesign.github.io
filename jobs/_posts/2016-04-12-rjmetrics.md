Work alongside some of the best engineers, designers, and marketers in the business on a diverse and exciting set of projects that will help us to better demonstrate the strengths of each of our products. This includes but isn’t limited to iterating on and executing a redesign of RJMetrics’ public web presence. Other examples include new marketing site and landing pages, email templates and other marketing and growth projects.

* Understand the DOM, and how to manipulate it with javascript
* Have an eye for design, and are opinionated about how a UI looks and feels
* Be fearless. We are looking for someone who isn’t afraid of getting their hands dirty in the terminal with some backend coding and hacking on and deploying with our awesome grunt-based static site generator
